# Horizen®
Horizen® is an LLM project that aims to help me train on LLMs and transformers.


## Getting started
To start using/developping Horizen®, start by setting up a python virtual environment:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

And then install the dependencies:

```shell
pip install torch
```

> Note: in the notebooks, don't forget to choose your virtual environment.
