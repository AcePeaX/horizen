I don't believe emotional suppression is a particularly admirable quality.

X amount of emotional energy will exist within your consciousness each day.

Do not fight it.

Some days you'll feel things very strongly, some days not feel much at all.

However, emotional selection is a superpower.

If you have the power to decide WHICH emotion you feel each day you have a distinct advantage.

There are days when it's very advantageous to feel angry or sad.

Do not SUPPRESS energy, CHANNEL it.

And channel into the most productive.

Happy is rarely productive.

I only select happy on special occasions, usually for the benefit of those around me.

Do you understand?
