There are flowers in the desert.

The harsh climate and sparse water doesn't stop all beauty from sprouting.

Those plants learn to deal with less,

They produce a small flower, but still flower, even in the most brutal conditions.

Most of their seeds die, never having had a single chance to even feel the sun.

BUT

The largest flowers in the world develop in rainforests.

A highly competitive environment with an absolute abundance of resources.

A game with a large variety of winners.

Some win staying low to the ground, some win towering up in the sky.

Winning is abundant.

If you were to compare the flowers found in the desert to the rainforest.

You would notice that the largest desert flower is actually SMALL in comparison to what was physically possible.

In raw terms of size, speed, offspring.

In RAW terms, ignoring the environment it was raised in,

The GREATEST desert flower would be entirely unremarkable.

When I tell you, that you are the sum of the 5 people you hang around most.

I'm not telling you that you cannot bloom.

Desert flowers exist.

But I'm telling you that they dwarf in comparison to a very average flower that lives in the heavy rain.

You can stay in the desert if you want.

But I recommend placing yourself where it rains.
