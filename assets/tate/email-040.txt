I have only one question for you.

Do you realize how hard it is to move quickly while you're shackled to the ground?

Shackles are heavy,

Constrictive.

Limiting.

If you can learn to move QUICKLY when shackled.

If your hand speed is still LIGHTNING despite the constraints.

Can you imagine what you can do when the shackles come off?

Unlimited opportunities that have been sitting there WAITING to be seized.

Opportunities JUST out of reach to be touched,

When the shackles come off, do you realize how much more can be accomplished?

Do you realize yet,

That we have only just begun?
