The game is rigged.

There are invisible and powerful forces specifically set to keep the average man down.

Resistance is required and movement is possible.

You can get far with enough strength, enough raw willpower.

You can climb the ladder, one ring at a time.

But have you ever wondered what it's like when the invisible forces pull you up instead of pushing you down?

Have you ever wondered what it's like to have the invisible hands work on your side?

To experience pockets of light in a darkening world?

The game is getting harder,

The deck is being stacked every day.

But there is a place where instead of it being stacked against you, it's in your favor.

A place where invisible hands exist, but they pull you up the ladder, they don't push you down it.

Escape before it is too late.
