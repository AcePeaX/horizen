Everyone is always looking for Easy.

Searching far and wide for this man and I don't understand why.

Easy is never really around anyone that great.

Easy is good friends with Average, Loser, Dumb.

Those are the only characters you'll ever find him hanging out with.

Everyone's looking for Easy and then wonder why everyone in their life is so shit.

Search for Hard instead,

He keeps much better company.
