There is a very simple reason you don't have everything you've ever wanted in life.

You don't have what you want,

Because you never TRIED to grab it.

You haven't fully understood that.

NO ONE IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

No one is going to place it in your hand.

Best case, they hold it out in front of you to grab it yourself.

Worst case, you need to fight them for it.

You need to get in the habit of reaching out to grab the things you want.

You want something?

Cool,

What's the plan?

What are you going to do RIGHT NOW to get it?

Want some money?

Cool, how are you going to convince someone to give it to you?

What's the next step? Building website? WHAT.

THINK AND EXECUTE.

REACH OUT AND GRAB WHAT YOU WANT.

Because it will never fall into your lap.

You aren't a child anymore, you can't whine and make noises.

No one gives a single fuck.

Go grab it, or live without it.

There are no other options.
