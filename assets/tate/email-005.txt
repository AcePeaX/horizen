It's amazing the things people care about.

When I was 15 I used to work at the fish market.

I carried boxes of fish around from 7am to 5pm.

I'd wake up at 6am,

Run to work.

Work from 7am to 5pm.

Run 1 hour to the gym.

Quickly eat at a shop nearby.

Train for 2 hours.

And get a ride home from my girlfriend at the time.

My entire life was 17-hour work days.

I became 4x World Champion this way.

I became a Billionaire this way.

I have a TOTAL DISREGARD for how much work something takes.

I don't care about the work.

I care about the payoff.

I've always only cared about the end result.

Everyone else CARES about work.

Trying to get rich, BUT only if they don't need to work too hard.

You tell them "This will get you rich" and their first question back is "How much work do I need to do?"

And that's why they're all poor.

Do you understand?
