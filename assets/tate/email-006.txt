Cost is the enemy of the poor man, so the poor try to save money. 

Time is the enemy of the rich man, so the rich try to save time.

When I was poor, I still valued Time > Cash.

I operated as a rich man long before I became rich.

Never waited for a bus, I took a taxi.

I was WORKING so hard that I knew my TIME had value.

Saving cash to lose time is a subliminal message that your time isn't effective.

You already WASTE time, so you don't need to PAY for more. 

I buy a 500k car and fly on private jets and amateurs think I'm wasting money.

Yet they drive slow cars and sit around in airports all day. They're wasting time.

I need my time to make more money than I'll spend saving time. 

A positive feedback loop into infinity. 

Your time is EXTREMELY valuable when you are doing the right things,

You just need to know the right things to do.

Do you understand?
