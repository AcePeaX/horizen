You're chasing money now.

But when you get it, you will realize you have been chasing power all along.

Money is a tool, a powerful tool

But money is not all-powerful.

Money can purchase most things,

House, car, passports, security, protection, manpower, help.

But it can't purchase everything.

It can't purchase love and it can't purchase care.

All the money in the world can't help you when a gun is to your head and the assailant cannot be bought.

All the money in the world can't help you when you don't know anyone even able to do the job.

You can be a billionaire and have a shit dentist.

Most expensive dentist in the world, sure, but he's just in it for a paycheck.

He doesn't CARE about you.

Money can get people to care so long as caring more earns them more money.

Rich geeks get played by countless women.

A fool with money is not powerful, he's a piggy bank for others.

Money IS important.

You can do a lot with just money.

But when you have all the money in the world, you'll figure out that you weren't chasing money.

You were chasing power.

And all the money in the world doesn't give it to you.

You need more.

Do you understand?
