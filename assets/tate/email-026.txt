Mercy is beautiful.

But, sooner or later, savagery is required less you become inept.

Neutered. 

Mercy is a sign of superiority and absolute power when you decide not to kill the hummingbird.

Why hurt the hummingbird?

It flew into the house and woke up the baby. 

But why punish such an ignorant creature for an act it did not understand?

Mercy is POWER in this instance.

But you cannot allow Mercy to be your master.

If Mercy was your master, you would spare the rat in your kitchen.

You would spare the termites inside your walls.

And eventually, you would be forced to KILL. 

Or you would lose any power at all.

Once the power structure turns, and you can no longer win, do you expect the rats or termites to be merciful to you?

Do you expect them to remember?

Mercy is the sign of good men. But sooner or later you must solve the problem with force.

If you delay too long the power dynamic changes absolutely and it's over.

When Mercy is your master, like the white man.

You eventually lose the ability to be merciful as your nations are forever conquered by people who will show you NO MERCY.

You grow weaker each day.

Time is running out.
