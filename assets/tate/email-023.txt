The problem with chaos is that you become very good at it. 

Soon - the idea of calm is not only unattractive. 

It's death.

Life becomes war. 

Spoils are monumental. 

Uncertainty supreme. 

Chaos becomes life. 

The alternative is death.

Do you think Great Men can ever go back to living a normal life ever again?
