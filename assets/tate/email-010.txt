Most people do not enjoy feeling afraid.

They live their whole lives trying to avoid Fear.

They don't answer his calls,

When they see him in the distance, they stop walking.

If he knocks at the door, they pretend not to be home.

But Fear is a friend, a very good friend.

Anything great has some level of REAL risk.

And that REAL risk induces REAL fear.

The difference between the great and the average,

Is the great do not AVOID fear, they understand him.

Fear is a signal that you're doing something BIG.

Fear is the warning to be on your A-game.

Fear is the sign that lets you know that you CAN NOT FAIL. 

Fear is a friend,

He's there to remind you.

The friend that will show up before every single fight to increase your powers. 

Fear is there before your greatest battles.

He comes with gifts to hand you for the war. 

You'll move faster when afraid. Ever jumped in the night?

Your hearing is heightened. 

Your eyesight is sharper. 

Shake his hand, acknowledge his warnings then move forward SUPER CHARGED.

Do not avoid fear.

Fear is at the door of everything great.
