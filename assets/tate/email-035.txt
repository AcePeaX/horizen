Supercars break and annoy you.

4 Wives? They'll fight.

Own a company? Work never stops.

You have to give up the peace of mind for an extraordinary life.

Learn to be at peace with the chaos.

Leave "peace" for the weak who can't handle pressure.

When old, they'll wish they lived harder.

The only true peace of mind is to care about nothing achieve nothing and be nothing.

If you want to do something that MATTERS.

Or want to have what others DON'T.

Become accustomed to the chaos of war.

HAVE IT ALL.

How HARD do you live?

What did you even do yesterday?

GENUINELY THINK AND ANSWER.

WHAT DID YOU DO YESTERDAY?

Reply to this email, write down your answer, press send, then look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself a very important question.

WHERE IS THE ACTION?
