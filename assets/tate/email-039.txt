You have two weapons to make money.

You can make money from money,

You can make money from time.

You can invest.

You can work.

Richer men invest,

Poorer men work.

But TRILLIONAIRES?

They do BOTH.

Elon works, Elon invests, he does BOTH.

He uses every resource at his disposal.

If you want to make money, look at your ONLY two tools.

Your money and your time.

How are you using them?
