Imagine buying a Lambo before you buy strength.

Buying a Rolex before you buy smarts.

I've met "men" with all the money in the world with skinny necks, weak arms and no brains.

They bought everything there is to buy except for what ACTUALLY matters.

The best part of being rich is I can do whatever the FUCK I want.

First thing I bought was food to fuel me.

Bought a trainer to turn me into a 4x world champ.

Bought experiences all over the world,

It's not cheap to end up on a Moldovan train headed to a random spot on a map.

I bought experiences to make me wise.

Bought everything I needed to become strong.

I've been coached by chess grandmasters.

MONEY IS NO ISSUE.

I buy what I want.

Hypercars, yes absolutely.

Diamond watches, YES.

But would I be TOP G if that's all I had?

Would anyone care who I was?

When you get money, you've got A LOT of things to buy.

You've got a long list.

Buy strength, buy wisdom first, the Lambo can wait.
