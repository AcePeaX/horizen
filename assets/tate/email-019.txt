The entire world is moved through manpower.

Everyone is looking for manpower to add to their cause and the cause with the most manpower wins.

Manpower isn't defined by the number of men,

It's defined by the amount of calories a brain burns towards a singular purpose, goal or cause.

10,000 losers won't help you.

Need them to vote? They forgot the day and stayed home.

Need them to fight? They're busy playing video games.

Need them to think? Their brains can barely function.

10 winners?

Billion-dollar companies have been built with less.

100? 

Can move countries.

1000?

Can move the world.

If you have ANY goals in your life.

ANYTHING worthy to be considered world-class.

You will NEED manpower.

You're one man, it won't be enough.

The fighter isn't enough, he NEEDS the coach, the sparring partners, the trainers.

Manpower is the true currency of this world,

And if you want to move mountains you will need a lot of it.

Ask yourself, how much manpower do you have for your fight?

And ask yourself how you can get more of it.
