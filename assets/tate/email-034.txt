Hardship is a beautiful thing.

The cleansing light of destruction shines on the details never before noticed.

You'll never know which one of your friends will fight until the battle comes.

You'll never know who will never give up until victory seems impossible.

Until the ship is sinking, you can never know who will spend their last moments helping you patch the holes.

You don't learn much in peace. 

Peace is for you to enjoy everything you learned in the war.

War is the father of innovation.

Systems break under increased pressure.

Repairs must be made and entire divisions refurbished or removed entirely.

There is as much or more beauty in the dark,

Then there ever is in the light.

Because there is no light at all without the dark.

You learn, grow and become stronger through hardship.

Not ease.

Be happy you're going through hardship.

It's the magic ingredient.
