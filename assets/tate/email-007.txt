It's not enough to be only exceptional in one realm.

With every single advantage you have,

It's not enough to be good at just ONE thing.

You need to be good at EVERYTHING.

Rich, Strong, Charismatic, Girl on Lock, Well-Connected, Wise.

EVERYTHING.

You have the entire world at your fingertips,

Sitting in your pocket.

I am a BILLIONAIRE writing to you RIGHT NOW.

This is not the past.

You have more knowledge, more resources and less bullshit to deal with than every one of your ancestors.

You cannot just be rich.

You cannot just be strong.

One is not enough anymore.

And if you do not understand this,

You will simply lose to those who do.
