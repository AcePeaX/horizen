I've endured events that I can remember and feel INSTANT fear.

With a simple recall.

ADRENALINE shocks my system. 

Then I pause. Remember I survived. 

And I can't wipe the smile off my face. 

My memories are an indefatigable source of elation. 

Of relief. 

How could I ever be depressed?

The reason most of you are miserable is that you've never smelt death. 

I assure you. It stinks. 

One whiff and fresh air alone will make you smile for the rest of your human years.
