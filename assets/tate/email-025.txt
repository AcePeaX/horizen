Your life should be a comic book.

ACTUALLY a comic book.

You may have a boring origin story.

Some childhood very mundane, spending your twenties or even thirties in a very average story.

But SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN.

Whether by tragedy or pure luck.

SOMETHING SHOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.

A moment or event where you find yourself in a completely novel situation.

Fate forever altered.

And that's why I have created a Golden Ticket.

Someone is going to find it.

They will find themselves on a flight to a country they've never been before.

To be mentored by BILLIONAIRES in the art of AIKIDO under the Romanian sunshine.

This is THE chance, 

It is the thing you do and think "No way it will be me"

And as it turns out.

Your life immediately becomes the comic book it should be.

Will you gamble on the chance? 

Will your life BECOME a comic book much like mine has?
