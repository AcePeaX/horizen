Inheritance is knowledge and mindset.

That's what a father gives his boys.

Money prevents them from experiencing the harshest lessons.

Vital lessons.

"I wouldn't leave you a dollar boy, even if I had it!"

My dad died with zero assets and 12usd in the bank.

I'm trying to die with 11.

HOW can my SON represent ME?

If I was poor and struggling but he wasn't?

I can teach but if he's not hungry enough to be taking life-or-death fights for pennies he can't become the man I am. 

Learn = live 

My fortune dies with me.

But with my lessons? 

He makes his own.

There is no worse fate for your son but for him to have daddy's money as a safety net. 

This generational wealth shit is for soft men who want to replicate soft men. 

I am not me because I'm rich. 

I'm me because I'm rich AND everything else. 

Thanks Dad.
