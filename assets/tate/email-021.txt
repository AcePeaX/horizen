You're moving too SLOWLY. You think too SLOWLY.

That is why the money never lands with you.

You're delaying and hoping you never have to make a hard choice.

BUT YOU MUST.

Times have changed.

It used to be that the big fish eats the small fish,

Now,

The FAST fish eats the slow fish.

We live in the Information Age,

If you are not fast, you will be eaten.

Every one of you is a slave because you're SLOW.

You live life SLOWLY.

And the slow get eaten.

Your friends don't tell you shit, 

You get your fastest news from the internet and by the time you see it insiders have already known for days.

You're already late.

I preach to you speed,

And you think you're going fast because you're faster than everyone around you, you tell yourself you're going fast.

But you don't even know what fast is.

You've got slow friends,

You've got slow goals,

You're surrounded by sloth,

I tell you how to fix it and you're slow to solve it.

If you're finally done fucking around.

I'll see you inside.
