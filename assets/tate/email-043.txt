Insurmountable odds, the worst situations.

I always feel a deep calm because I do not believe I can fail.

I'll smile as the Titanic sinks, finding a way to SURVIVE.

I've believed in myself so strongly, for so many years.

That I can't even imagine the feeling of self-doubt.

There is a psychological barrier preventing you from achieving things the FIRST time.

But achieved ONCE, there is little doubt that you could do it AGAIN.

After the first time I knocked someone out, I knocked everybody out.

I didn't hit any harder.

I just believed I could.
